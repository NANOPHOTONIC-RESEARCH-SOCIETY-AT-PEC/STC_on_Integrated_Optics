# STC_on_Integrated_Optics
Organized By Department of ECE at PEC(Deemed to be university), Chandigarh

**Integrated optics is a technology which aims at constructing so-called integrated optical devices or photonic integrated circuits or planar lightwave circuits, containing several or many optical components which are combined  to perform a wide variety of optical functions. Recent developments in nanostructures, metamaterials, and silicon technologies have expanded the range of possible functionalities of optical devices on highly integrated chips. Photonic integrated circuits  have the ability to perform all the operations with light as the quintessential factor. Photonics has high potential of development, but it needs a thorough scientific research to perform light manipulation for all operations. Because of its limitless potential, Photonics find its application in on chip communication, healthcare diagnostics, processing industry, mobility, safety and security, and agro-food etc. With focus on advancements in integrated photonics, this short term course (STC) will serve as a guide for academic researchers and faculty on latest aspects of light-matter interactions on-a-chip. Covering the progress from theory to technical descriptions, the course plans to cover the advancements in a wide range of topics, including Silicon Photonic, Nonlinear Optics, optoelectronic materials and devices, Plasmonics, Bio-Nano photonics etc.. The course will give an insight into advancements happening in the field of integrated photonic devices in order to meet the needs of relevant industry, space, defense and research organization.**
